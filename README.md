Report: The Impact of Humidity Conditions on Pitching Performance

# Abstract:
This report delves into the profound influence of weather conditions on a pitcher's performance. It explores how varying weather elements can significantly alter a pitcher's ability to execute their pitches, specifically focusing on the impact of high humidity and dew point. We concentrate on Cincinnati during the summer months, a location notorious for its elevated humidity levels. Our primary objective is to ascertain the likelihood of pitches being influenced by a dew point exceeding 65 degrees Fahrenheit.
# Introduction:
It is commonly assumed that humid air is more dense than dry air, primarily due to the misconception that moisture in the air imparts a sensation of heaviness, making it challenging to breathe and prompting sweating. However, this prevailing belief is contrary to reality. Humid air is indeed less dense than its dry counterpart, provided they share the same temperatures. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises from the replacement of heavier molecules like nitrogen and oxygen by water molecules in humid conditions.
# The Physics of Pitching in Humid Air:
As a baseball travels through the air, gravity and air resistance exert forces upon it. The key factor under consideration here is air resistance. When comparing humid and dry air, the former is less dense, resulting in reduced air resistance for a baseball in flight. Consequently, pitches can travel greater distances in humid conditions compared to dry conditions. This decrease in air resistance has a more pronounced effect on certain pitch types, particularly curveballs and sliders, which heavily rely on air resistance for their movements. In higher humidity conditions, the reduced air resistance can lead to less movement or even unpredictable behavior of the ball.
# Methodology:
Our methodology for predicting the probability of humidity's effect on a pitch involves an individualized approach for each pitcher. This approach recognizes the uniqueness of each pitcher's style and techniques, thus emphasizing the importance of isolating specific pitcher data. Further, we meticulously analyze the data concerning each pitch type. Each type of pitch possesses distinctive characteristics that govern the ball's behavior. We then compute the averages for the rotations per minute (rpm), speed, horizontal-induced break, and vertically-induced break data to derive the expected ball movement data.
By comparing each pitch's actual performance to the expected ball movement data, we can assess whether the ball is behaving as anticipated.
# Challenges and Limitations:
However, it's essential to acknowledge that an inconsistent ball movement does not necessarily result from the dew point. Various other variables, such as wind speed and direction, can contribute to the inconsistency. For the purposes of this project, we assume an absence of these variables. Yet, even with this assumption, our analysis may not be entirely reliable. The absence of specific dew point data leaves us unable to establish a direct correlation, resulting in substantial reliance on assumptions.
# Probability Calculation:
In this report, you will observe that our predicted probability of dew point effectiveness consistently hovers around 50% or in its proximity. We believe this is a justifiable starting point, given the absence of concrete dew point data. Our methodology involves adding or subtracting a mere 1 percent after conducting a thorough analysis of expected movement. This slight adjustment suggests whether the pitch might have been influenced by the dew point. The rationale for maintaining a probability close to 50% lies in our commitment to avoiding unrealistic assumptions without substantial dew point data.
# Conclusion:
In conclusion, this report highlights the intricate relationship between weather conditions, particularly high humidity and dew point, and a pitcher's performance. It underscores the need for accurate data and direct correlations to make reliable assessments. While humidity and dew point undoubtedly play a role in pitch effectiveness, their impact remains subtle. The data should, therefore, reflect this subtlety and remain close to the 50% baseline probability.
